A web page that you can interact with that returns a show, even if it doesn't necessarily match your interests.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO
Best case is I get the whole site built and programmed and it works to return a show the user would like based on what they input.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO 
My next steps will be to go through web module on canvas to start off with learning how to create and program a webpage. Then i'll find more areas and learn the skills more in depth. I'll need to research how to get the webpage to return recommendations and also what language is best to work in. The skills I need to learn are Web-development and web-scraping. Some design skills and how to import databases.
